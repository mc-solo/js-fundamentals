// In JavaScript, values are broadly categorized as "truthy" or "falsy" based on their inherent boolean interpretation. These concepts come into play when JavaScript expects a boolean value, such as in conditional statements (if, while, etc.) or in logical operators.

const money = false;

if (money) console.log(`Don't spend it all`);
else console.log(`Go get a job`);
